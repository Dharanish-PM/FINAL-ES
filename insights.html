                            trading company
                            whose operations pre covid was in silos and conventional. The deep root analysis and risk mitigation of

                            transformation to the digital front was initiated during the covid era. Though the business was on
                            capital goods but not
                            the FMCG sector, the project was taken as a turn key and the insights offered by the consulting team for
                            business
                            excellence resulted in 40% increase in the cumulative sales for the fiscal year 2020-2021. The data

                            reports were presented to the client on a regular basis and operational and financial optimizations were
                            carried in the
                            way forward. The iterative design and management strategies were brainstormed on regular intervals and

                        <p>In stock markets, they say, you can never perfectly time when to buy or when to sell. Your graduation
                            could not have
                            come at a more tumultuous time—in the midst of a pandemic not witnessed by generations. While COVID-19
                            has been a
                            global challenge of epic proportions—it has also thrown up opportunities for all of us—to make an even
                            bigger impact on
                            enterprises, governments, and society at large. [As Winston Churchill once said, never waste a good
                            crisis!]
                        </p>
                        <p>During this crisis, as a nation, we created our own vaccine. We manufactured vaccines in quantities that
                            the world has
                            never seen before. We created a distribution mechanism to jab almost a billion people in every nook and
                            corner of the
                            country. And, we helped save not only the citizens of India but that of the world. India today has more
                            Internet users
                            in villages than in cities. Rural India has 20 percent more Internet users than urban areas. India has
                            surpassed every
                            nation, including China and the U.S., in digital financial transactions. Notably, India had the highest
                            real-time
                            payments—with over 40 percent of payments worldwide in 2021 being done here. And finally, the Indian
                            economy is just one

                        <p>All this has been possible because of human ingenuity, confidence and hope, a willpower to make it
                            happen—and above all,
                            the willingness to embrace technology. While in prior decades, technology was an enabler of businesses,
                            today technology
                            is the language of business. Moderna, a leading U.S. biotech firm, created a vaccine for COVID-19 using
                            the mRNA
                            formula, largely driven by technology:

                            <li>A proprietary in-house digital application to tailor genetic code</li>
                            <li>A Design Studio with cloud-based computational capability for on-demand computing</li>
                            <li>An analytics-driven Research Engine to power parallel intake and design of multiple mRNA sequences

                            <li>Automation platforms for mRNA synthesis</li>
                            <li>IoT technologies for distributed production across plants</li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>
            
                        <p>Just imagine how many experts—bio-technologists, biologists, pharmacists, architects, data analysts,
                            professionals would
                            have come together to create this vaccine—breaking down boundaries and interweaving their unique
                            expertise. That’s the
                            opportunity ahead for technologists and engineers like you!</p>
            
                        <p>Most would argue that India is perhaps best placed to capitalize on such opportunities thrown up by this
                            “new order”. No
                            other country in the world can claim to have the talent and technology know-how at scale.</p>

                        <p>Three distinct, interrelated phases—the decision setup, the time during which the decision is made, and
                            the decision
                            follow-through—provide a framework for building decision-making practices that support an organization’s
                            values and
                            impact goals.</p>
            
                        <p>Today’s uncertain environment presents an overwhelming number of decisions nonprofits need to make to
                            continue to serve
                            their constituents, endure through turbulent times, and plan for the future. In the article “A Compass
                            for the Crisis:
                            Nonprofit Decision Making in the COVID-19 Pandemic,” we laid out the importance of defining
                            decision-making
                            principles—like equity, financial sustainability, and mission-centricity—that can help you make
                            difficult decisions and
                            tradeoffs without compromising organizational values.</p>
            
                        <p>Here, we put the principles into practice by exploring the behaviors that organizations can adopt to
                            ensure their
                            decision-making processes consistently support their values. These practices help teams to center on
                            equity during
                            decision making, clarify roles and expectations of those involved in decisions making, and ensure
                            transparency
                            throughout the process. When consistently applied to key decisions and adopted by an organization’s
                            leadership and
                            staff, effective decision-making practices can ensure that both the process and outcomes of these
                            important decisions

                        <p>While these practices will serve an organization admirably during normal times, they are exceedingly
                            well-suited to
                            guiding decision making during periods when a crisis has shortened timelines for decisions, undermined
                            the social
                            connections enjoyed in the context of working together, and heightened the perceived stakes involved in
                            every decision.So, what does a good decision-making process look like? We believe it includes three
                            distinct, but interrelated, phases
                            as follows.
            
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h6>The Decision Setup</h6>
                                <p>In the tumult of leading during a crisis, the first casualty is often the vitally important work
                                    of establishing the
                                    ground rules for how you will make decisions. Yet this step is just as, and probably more,
                                    crucial during a crisis, when
                                    the consequences of decisions are both more immediate and, in some cases, highly disruptive to
                                    people and departments.
                                    Take time to do the setup, which includes establishing the roles, goals, and responsibilities of
                                    each decision maker and
                                    putting focus and parameters around what is (and what is not) being decided. Team members need
                                    to know that while not
                                    everybody will participate in every decision, those affected by the decision should participate,
                                    particularly those
                                    typically marginalized, to ensure the right voices are at the table.</p>
            
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>Decision-Making Time</h6>
                                <p>During tough times, especially when team members are working remotely, you will lose some of the
                                    focused camaraderie of
                                    being together around the conference table, making eye contact, seeing heads nod, and so forth.
                                    Still, your task during
                                    the decision-making step is to engage in the same kind of open and constructive debate you would
                                    have if you were in the
                                    same room. To compensate for the distance, be deliberate about pushing against the status quo as
                                    needed, and evaluating
                                    options with data that has been examined for bias</p>
            
                            </li>
            
                            <li>
                                <h6>The Decision Follow-Through</h6>
                                <p>No decision is complete until it has been executed. Once you’ve made a decision, hold yourself
                                    and your fellow
                                    leadership team members accountable for implementing the results. Just as important, don’t keep
                                    your stakeholders
                                    sweating for news of your decision. Proactively communicate the process and outcome of the
                                    decision to your
                                    community—once again, with special care given to those most affected by it, such as colleagues,
                                    clients, or partners.
                                    You may choose to communicate one-on-one, in groups, online, or in any other fashion, but be
                                    sure that the underlying
                                    message is that your stakeholders are part of your team and have a stake in the decision.</p>
